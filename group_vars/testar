# Basically all of this info will become part of the README.
#
# Definitions:
#
# NOTE: Many of these terms are intentionally misspelled. The purpose of this is to help
# maintain manageability. For example, the first term below 'servis' is merely a misspelling
# of 'service'. The misspelled option is more easily located and distinguished in code bases,
# which often use these common terms in many different contexts. Should a term ever need to
# be renamed or modified procedurally, the find/replace or other operation will be much
# easier on the human running it and there may be 100 instances of the misspelled term to
# sort through instead of (in some cases) thousands of unrelated instances in the case of
# using a generic term spelled correctly.
#
#
# servis: Roughly synonymous to terms like 'service', or 'deployment'. A servis is a
#   server (or servers working together) to do an assigned job such as run builds, host a
#   package cache, store backups, or etc.
#
# servisName, servisType: Each servis has a "servisName" and is an instance of its
#   "servisType", just as a traditional programming object is an instance of its declaration.
#   Servis names and types are semi-arbitrary so long as they are consistent in the couple
#   of places they are defined. A servis named 'debby' might be of the servisType 'apt-cache',
#   while a servis named 'who' might be of the servisType 'bind9-deployment'.
#
# servisParams: A data-structure that stores these other parameters that define a servis,
#   which takes the form of an Ansible group_vars file named for the servisName.
#
# node: A servis consists of node(s); each node is a host/instance/VM. (This term is
#   practically interchangeable with Ansible's term 'host'; the only reason 'node' has not
#   already been replaced with 'host' is to see if it is helpful to distinguish pansi
#   resources from other Ansible resources).
#
#   Node are placed into groups in Ansible's live inventory based on a list of groups
#   defined in the servisParams, and Ansible plays and roles are run on the nodes
#   depending on their group membership. (This is normal Ansible functionality, the
#   difference is the method used to add the nodes to their groups dynamically from the
#   groups list)
#
# provider: Nodes are provided by providers. These are Infrastructure as a Service (IAAS)
#   providers such as EC2 and Rackspace. Providers' names are semi-arbitrary, as long as they
#   match in the couple of places they are defined in pansi. Providers are actually a reference
#   to an individual tennant/project/VPC-subnet within an IAAS provider (as opposed to the
#   entire IAAS company, or everything a you host there... which would be too broad). Example
#   provider names might be 'awapne2' if you had a single VPC in the Asia-Pacific
#   Northeast-2 region of AWS or 'raxord2' for the second of two Rackspace accounts that
#   deploy into the ORD datacenter in Chicago.
#
# typeLabel: A node's "typeLabel" is its primary group. The fictitious servis this file
#   describes ('testar') is primarily tasked with running Jenkins, but it also hosts LDAP.
#   So the typeLabel is 'jenkins', and the one "additional_group" defined is 'ldap'. Aside
#   from providing a portion of the node's name in IAAS providers, distinguishing one group
#   as the typeLabel is merely intended as a convenience for us humans. (testar is an instance
#   of the ficticious servisType 'skylab', a name which could reflect the logistical/oversight
#   aspects of the work it does.)
#
#   The deploy order is determined by the playbook for the servisType and does not
#   depend on which group is the typeLabel. The playbook deploying a skylab servis needs
#   LDAP running before Jenkins can use it for auth, so the group and plays for LDAP in
#   the skylab playbook are actually processed first in spite of LDAP not being those
#   node's typeLabel.
#
#   However, changing the typeLabel to a different group (whether to an added group or
#   swapping it out with one of its existing additional_groups) requires redeploying the
#   servis, or you'll end up with twice the intended nodes (one set with the new typeLabel,
#   and one orphaned set set with the old one *which may still be serving requests*).

servisParams:

  # name of servis
  servisName: testar

  # skylab is the internal name for the type of servis that runs builds, hosts an apt cache, and etc.
  servisType: skylab

  # this skylab is a crossSyncedPair, which sync results of new builds to one another
  #   - a servis with only one variant may not need a value for servisVariant
  #   - it is legal to use servisVariant when there is only one variant (perhaps more are expected)
  servisVariant: crossSyncedPair

  # the key to tell the IAAS provider to use when creating the instance, and to then use to get into it
  sshKeyName: fabrikamdeploy

  # variables that this servisType (skylab), will expect
  #   - these are used by Ansible roles that configure services, not by the roles that install the software
  #   - it is bad to use the variables inside shared roles that install software

#WORK-IN-PROGRESS BELOW HERE
      ##
      ## ADDITIONAL FUTURE ATTRIBUTES OF NODES
      ##
      ## These are node attributes that were previously defined elsewhere or used their defaults.
      ## Either a block like this will get added directly to each defined node, or they may move
      ## into group_vars/all and be defined as "option sets", so that each node can define an
      ## option set.
