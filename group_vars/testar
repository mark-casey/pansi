  # this skylab is a crossSyncedPair, which sync results of new builds to one another

      ## These are node attributes that were previously defined elsewhere or used their defaults.
      ## Either a block like this will get added directly to each defined node, or they may move
      ## into group_vars/all and be defined as "option sets", so that each node can define an
      ## option set.
