  # this skylab is a crossSyncedPair, which sync results of new builds to one another

  # variables that this servisType (skylab), will expect
  #   - these are used by Ansible roles that configure services, not by the roles that install the software
  #   - it is bad to use the variables inside shared roles that install software

      ## ADDITIONAL FUTURE ATTRIBUTES OF NODES
      ##
      ## These are node attributes that were previously defined elsewhere or used their defaults.
      ## Either a block like this will get added directly to each defined node, or they may move
      ## into group_vars/all and be defined as "option sets", so that each node can define an
      ## option set.
