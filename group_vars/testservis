# The README currently doesn't get into any of the terms or concepts that are currently
# pansi-specific things (it only mentions that a goal is to simplify/reduce them).
#
# A lot of this info will move to the README.
#
# This is partly re-explained below... but a lot of the pansi-specific terms and concepts are intentionally
# misspelled, which is a practice that helps with the continued manageability of infrastructure-as-code and
# infrastructure-as-data projects. (i.e.: the first term is 'servis' instead of 'service', so that if the
# time comes to change it to something else, there aren't 219,241 results in the find-replace to sort through!)
#
#
#
# Definitions:
#
# The term 'servis' is roughly synonymous to terms like 'site', 'service', or 'deployment',
#   but the word and parameter names derived from it (ex.: servisParams) are more easily
#   located and distinguished in code bases, which will often use these more common
#   terms in many different contexts. A servis is a server (or servers working together)
#   to do an assigned job such as run builds, host a package cache, store backups, or etc.
#
# The servis represented by "serviceName" is an instance of its given "servisType", just
#   as a traditional programming object is an instance of its declaration.
#
# #FIXME: define servisParams (it's a file like this one!)
#
# #FIXME: may want to change node to be host (host in the Ansible sense of the word)
# A servis consists of nodes; each node is a host/instance/VM. The nodes are placed into
#   groups in Ansible's inventory based on a list of groups defined in the servisParams,
#   and Ansible plays and roles are run on the nodes depending on their group membership.
#
# Nodes are provided by... "providers". These are Infrastructure as a Service (IAAS)
#   providers such as EC2, Rackspace, and etc. Providers' names look like 'awapne2' or
#   'raxord2', and (in this context) are actually a reference to an individual
#   tennant/project/VPC-subnet within an IAAS provider (as opposed to the entire
#   IAAS company, or everything a you host there... which would be too broad).
#
# A node's "typeLabel" is its primary group. The ficticious servis this file describes
#   ('testar') is primarily tasked with running Jenkins, but it also hosts LDAP. So the
#   typeLabel is 'jenkins', and the one "additional_group" defined is 'ldap'. Aside from
#   providing a portion of the node's name in IAAS providers, distinguishing one group as the
#   typeLabel is merely intended as a convenience for us humans. (testar is an instance of the
#   ficticious servisType 'skylab', a name which could reflect the logistical/oversight
#   aspects of the work it does.)
#
#   The deploy order is determined by the playbook for the servisType and does not
#   depend on which group is the typeLabel. The playbook deploying a skylab servis needs
#   LDAP running before Jenkins can use it for auth, so the group and plays for LDAP in
#   the skylab playbook are actually processed first in spite of LDAP not being those
#   node's typeLabel.
#
#   However, changing the typeLabel to a different group (whether to an added group or
#   swapping it out with one of its existing additional_groups) requires redeploying the
#   servis, or you'll end up with twice the intended nodes (one set with the new typeLabel,
#   and one orphaned set set with the old one *which may still be serving requests*).

servisParams:

  # name of servis
  servisName: testar

  # skylab is the internal name for the type of servis that runs builds, hosts an apt cache, and etc.
  servisType: skylab

  # this skylab is a crossSyncedPair, which sync results of new builds to one another
  #   - a servis with only one variant may not need a value for servisVariant
  #   - it is legal to use servisVariant when there is only one variant (perhaps more are expected)
  servisVariant: crossSyncedPair

  # the key to tell the IAAS provider to use when creating the instance, and to then use to get into it
  sshKeyName: fabrikamdeploy

  # variables that this servisType (skylab), will expect
  #   - these are used by Ansible roles that configure services, not by the roles that install the software
  #   - it is bad to use the variables inside shared roles that install software

#WORK-IN-PROGRESS BELOW HERE
      ##
      ## ADDITIONAL FUTURE ATTRIBUTES OF NODES
      ##
      ## These are node attributes that were previously defined elsewhere or used their defaults.
      ## Either a block like this will get added directly to each defined node, or they may move
      ## into group_vars/all and be defined as "option sets", so that each node can define an
      ## option set.
